        Flutter is an open source UI toolkit, developed by Google. I have used it for multiple apps, and I can tell you that it is
        simply amazing. I found that I was able to build full user interfaces that were incredibly close to native performance in
        an incredibly short time. Unlike many other platforms, such as React Native, Flutter comes with a handful of useful widgets
        out of the box. Personally, I will be using it for Android and iOS development for a long time to come.

        Despite all this, there is still one major issue with Flutter. Flutter web is a relatively newer feature which allows you to build
        Flutter apps as an HTML canvas element, with custom rendering. Unfortunately, the performance of Flutter web is still very poor. There
        are slow loading times, unnatural feeling interactions and several other issues that are yet to be resolved. There is a way to build
        your Flutter app as native HTML and JavaScript, but many things still feel very artificial. For example, the simulated scrolling is extremely
        buggy and choppy. For now, traditional JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue or Angular are probably a better option for a web app.
        <br>
        <br>
        To conclude, Flutter is an amazing framework and is 100% the option to go with for cross-platform <i>mobile</i> apps. If you also plan for
        a web release of your app, you may want to consider separate codebases for your mobile version built with Flutter and your web app built with
        any modern JavaScript framework. React is still a perfectly valid option for a separate web app.
