        The main feature of my project, Cloudvision, is the ability to identify a cloud formation by simply pointing you phone's camera towards the sky.
        Quite honestly, I knew this was going to be the trickiest part if the project from day one. Dart is an incredible language and no doubt you can
        do anything you could do in another language, but that isn't the problem. The problem is something inherent to almost every modern programming language,
        that is, the lack of packages. Sure, there are hundreds of Flutter state-management packages out there, but when it comes to something as simple as a half-
        usable image manipulation package, nothing. I was trying to keep all code in Dart to avoid messy cross-language logic but it was starting to become evident
        that this was not going to happen. The way I saw it, I was going to spend a couple months writing a custom neural network in Python that I could then use in
        Cloudvision. However, this changed when I watched the Google IO 2021 Developer Conference, where <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/tflite" style="text-decoration: none; color: #4287f5">TensorFlow Lite</a>
        was released for Flutter. This was huge news for me and cut at least 2 months of work down to 2 weeks. Incase you are unaware of what TensorFlow is, here is an explanation.
        <br>
        <br>
        TensorFlow is a Machine Learning library released by Google in 2015. Written in Python, it features various functions for easy application of trained models.
        Google also offers a simple online tool for training a model. <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #4287f5" href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/">Teachable Machine</a>
        is a web-based application for training machines. One of the key features are the image classification models. All you do is upload a dataset of images to each class and click a button. In
        a matter of minutes, a model is created, ready to be exported to TensorFlow.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now that I have touched on exactly what TensorFlow is, let me showcase how easy it was to implement it into the app. After installing the tflite package, you download your Teachable Machine
        model into the directory. In the code, you must first load this model like so:

        <p style="font-weight: 400;">After this, to input something into this model and return a result, all you need to do is create a short function:</p>
